My awesome wife made this up, and it was fantastic!!

Ingredients:
============

* Butter
* Garlic
* 1 can diced tomatoes
* Portabella mushrooms
* 10-15 leaves of fresh basil
* Sriracha sauce
* Fresh grated parmesan cheese
* Spaghetti

Directions:
===========

1. Place 2 tbsp of butter in skillet. Turn heat to medium and allow butter to melt. Add garlic, diced tomatoes, and mushroom. Simmer until mushrooms have shrunk down.
2. Add a “swirl around the pan” of the Sriracha sauce to pan. Add Parmesan. Stir. Cook until cheese melts. Just before sauce is finished add basil. Once basil is soft, sauce is finished.
3. Pour sauce over spaghetti. Mix well. Top with parmesan and serve.
4. Add shrimp or chicken, if you prefer non-vegetarian dishes.
